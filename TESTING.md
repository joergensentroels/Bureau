# Bureau — Testing

## Run it

```sh
node test/run-all.mjs --serve     # pure + server suites; boots a throwaway server itself. THE command.
node test/run-all.mjs             # pure suites; server suites only if a server is already up on :4174
node test/run-all.mjs --e2e       # also the live autonomy e2e (needs Latch + a local model)
node test/coverage-audit.mjs      # soft audit: exported fns / routes not tested AND not listed below
node eval/recall-eval.mjs         # recall@3 of memory retrieval, shipped ranker vs alternatives (live)
node eval/parallel-eval.mjs       # sequential-vs-parallel delegation A/B, repeated runs (live, ~4min/pair)
```

`--serve` self-hosts a Bureau on :4174 (generating its own `OPERATOR_TOKEN`, so no Latch/auth.json
needed) and tears it down after. Exits non-zero on any failure — it's the pre-push and CI gate.

## The gate (how we avoid pushing broken/untested code)

1. **Pre-push hook** (`.githooks/pre-push`) runs `run-all.mjs --serve` and blocks the push on red.
   Enable once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Emergency bypass: `git push --no-verify`.
2. **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs the same on every push/PR — the authoritative gate.
3. **This ledger + `coverage-audit.mjs`**: every exported function and `/api`+`/mcp` route must be
   either referenced by a test OR listed under "Intentionally not auto-tested" below (with a reason).
   The rule: **no new export/endpoint ships without a test or a ledger entry.**

## Suites

- **Pure** (`decision`, `units`, `net`) — no server, no model. Logic, validators, SSRF guard, BM25,
  the semaphore, the approval-decision core (incl. hard floor).
- **Server** (`api`, `workspaces`, `robustness`) — hit a running server (no model). CRUD + validation,
  auth gate + role separation, security headers, MCP JSON-RPC, steer routing, SOP CRUD, spend cap,
  workspace isolation, hardening/malformed-input.
- **Live e2e** (`e2e-autonomy`, `--e2e` only) — needs Latch + a local LLM. Proves the safe-autonomy stack
  composes: trusted-tier auto-approve → policy `require` overriding the tier → the in-app approval seam →
  DoD verdict → policy `block` refusing a write before any approval is filed. _9/9 passing as of
  2026-07-31; before that it had never been run since the auth gate landed in July._
  - Scenarios that need the model to propose a specific action **retry up to 3×** and report
    **INCONCLUSIVE**, not failed, if it never does — exit code stays 0. A live suite that goes red
    because a nondeterministic model picked a different tool teaches people to ignore it.
  - Teardown restores the policies and tier it changed, and denies **only** approvals that appeared
    during the run (diffed against a startup baseline, so it can never resolve one it didn't cause).
    It **cannot** remove the deliverables its runs write — there is no delete endpoint — so it prints
    them by name instead of claiming to have cleaned up.

## Coverage of the 2026-07 feature + security work

| Area | Where tested |
|---|---|
| Parallel primitive `makeSemaphore` — reaches the cap, not merely stays under it | units |
| Shared memory `rankByRelevance` / `recallSharedMemory` / `/api/memory` | units + api |
| SOPs `normSop` / `sopObjective` / CRUD | units + api |
| `mcp_call` hard-floor | decision |
| MCP server (`/mcp` initialize/tools/list/tools/call/errors) | api |
| Auth gate + role separation + security headers | api |
| Header-only tokens — `?token=` rejected everywhere, incl. the SSE stream | api |
| Failed-auth damper (429 past threshold, cleared by a success) + `kind:"auth"` audit rows | api |
| Damper log-flood bound — 31 failures log ≤3 audit rows | api |
| Remote mode (`BUREAU_REMOTE`) allowlist + fail-closed (`remoteBlocksApproval`, `approvalActType`) | units |
| Vectors: `packVec`/`unpackVec` round-trip, `cosine`, `rrfFuse`, `memoryKey`/`memoryText` | units |
| Hybrid recall — vector+BM25 fusion and every degrade-to-lexical path | units |
| Recall de-dup: `objectiveSignature`, `dedupeMemories`, summary-over-recency, per-agent scope | units |
| Deliverable ranking (BM25 over filename+content) + `deliverableEmbedText` | units |
| `chunkDocument` / `deliverableChunks` — boundaries, overlap, size + count caps, title per passage | units |
| `/api/rag` deliverable retrieval inspection | api |
| `DELETE /api/deliverables/:name` — validation, not-found, traversal neutralised | api (happy path live) |
| Inbound triggers — unknown/disabled token → 404, token shape, list auth | api (guards live) |
| Failed-run accounting — abnormal exits audited with a reason, counted, listed in `/api/runs` | workspaces |
| Notification webhook — `/api/notify/test`, dead endpoint → 502 + audit row, HTTP 500 ≠ delivered | workspaces |
| `run_failed` push on the failure path (it used to push nothing) | workspaces |
| `/stop` on an unknown run → 404 (it used to confirm `ok:true`) | robustness |
| Goal-linked schedule lifecycle — done disables, re-open resumes, delete removes | api |
| `nextRunAt` on PATCH — settable, clamped to a year, non-numeric → 400 | api |
| `/api/embeddings` status + `/api/embeddings/backfill` + `/api/memory?lexical=` switch | api |
| Approval seam validation (unknown id → 404, bad decision → 400) | api |
| Role introspection `/api/whoami` (operator + readonly) | api |
| Per-run paid cap (`maxPaidUsdPerRun`) | api |
| Steer endpoint routing+auth | api |
| SSRF guard (`fetchUrl`, `apiCall`, incl. DNS-pin refusals) | net |

## Intentionally not auto-tested (accounted for — audit allowlist)

**Retrieval quality is measured, not asserted** (`eval/recall-eval.mjs`, needs a live server + embedder):
recall@3 over 12 labelled queries against the live corpus. It exists because a single bad-looking query
is a terrible reason to change a ranker — every "obvious" improvement to the fusion measured the same or
worse. Re-run it before and after any change to `rankByRelevance`, the fusion weights, or the embedding
model, in the same session, and compare the ordering rather than the absolute numbers.

**The browser UI has no automated coverage.** It is syntax-checked by extracting the inline `<script>`
and running `node --check` on it, which catches parse errors but not runtime ones. Anything behavioural
there is verified by loading `http://127.0.0.1:4173/` in a browser and reading the console + network log.
_Done 2026-07-31: the page boots with no JS errors; unauthenticated, it correctly shows `⚠ not signed in`
while keeping `👁 read-only` and `🔒 remote mode` hidden; and the **poller gate holds** — six boot requests
and then silence, where the 2s/7s/12s pollers would otherwise have kept firing (they were measured at
~83 requests/minute before that fix)._

**The scheduler, observed firing for the first time** (needs a live server + model; verified 2026-07-31,
10 checks). It runs on a 60s timer and had never been seen working — because it *couldn't* be: no API
path could make a schedule due (`PATCH` ignored `nextRunAt`, enabling an overdue schedule pushed it a
cadence forward, and `POST /:id/run` bypasses `tickSchedules` altogether). With `nextRunAt` settable, a
due schedule fires, `lastRunAt` is set and `nextRunAt` advances by one cadence without replaying a
backlog. Scripted rather than in the suite because it must wait out real 60-second ticks.

**Inbound trigger guards end-to-end** (needs a live server + model; verified 2026-07-31, 9 checks): fires
with no credential (by design), an immediate second fire and 5 rapid retries all 429 with `retryAfterMs`,
refusals and the accepted fire both audited, sustained bad-token probing trips the failed-auth damper and
appears in the audit log, and a disabled trigger stays a 404. Firing needs a model, so the enforcement
path is scripted rather than in the server suite.

**Deliverable deletion end-to-end** (needs a live server + embedder; verified 2026-07-31, 16 checks): the
happy path needs a real file on disk, which only an agent run or a direct write produces, so the server
suite covers validation/not-found/traversal and the round-trip is scripted against a throwaway workspace —
archive is byte-identical and readable via the versions endpoint, retrieval stops citing the document,
neighbours untouched, no orphaned pending vectors, exactly one audit row, and a second delete 404s.

**Chunked retrieval end-to-end** (needs a live server + embedder; verified 2026-07-30): a synthetic
12,165-char document with a distinctive fact at char 9296 is retrieved by paraphrase, and the excerpt
returned is the buried passage rather than the document opening. Worth re-running as a script if chunking
changes — the real corpus has no document long enough to exercise it (largest 1489 bytes).

**Need a live embedding model (manually verified, scripted):**
- `embedText` — the one network call in the vector path. Needs `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`; the
  suites deliberately make no network calls, and every caller treats a null vector as "fall back to
  BM25", which the unit tests do cover. _Verified live 2026-07-30: 45 entries embedded at 768 dims, 0
  failures, and hybrid recall beat BM25 on 6/6 pre-chosen paraphrase queries._

**Need a live Latch (manually verified, scripted):**
- `BUREAU_REMOTE` refusing a real pending approval — needs a pending Latch approval, so the endpoint
  path is verified live (403 + audit row on `act-shell`, deny still 200, `act-note` still approves,
  untagged fails closed). The decision logic itself is unit-tested.
- Per-workspace Inbox filtering via the `ws-` tag (verified live 2026-07-30 after the colon fix).

**Need a live model / Latch (covered by `--e2e`, or manually verified):**
- Parallel `delegate` end-to-end, `ask_peer` / `consultPeer`, `mcp_call` end-to-end (needs a real MCP
  server in Latch's `data/mcp.json`).
- `askLlm`, `paidProviderAvailable`, `initLatchAuth` — thin wrappers over the model/Latch.
- `ragTokens` — trivial tokenizer, exercised transitively by the `rankByRelevance` tests.

**Eval harness internals** (exercised by `eval/run-eval.mjs`, not the unit suite):
`buildDecomposeMsgs`, `buildCriteriaMsgs`, `buildVerifyMsgs`, `validateCriteria`, `validateVerify`,
`validateDecompose`.

**Latch-proxy / read endpoints** (thin pass-throughs to Latch, or return live state — validated
manually / via Latch's own tests): `/api/state`, `/api/llm/chat`, `/api/llm/config`,
`/api/mcp/servers`, `/api/github/config`, `/api/bio/generate`.

**Pre-existing endpoints not yet back-filled with tests (acknowledged backlog, predate this work):**
`/api/purchases`, `/api/inbox`, `/api/inbox/seen`, `/api/ceo`, `/api/agent-status`, `/api/hr/suggest`,
`/api/hr/plan`, `/api/hr/hire-plan`, `/relocate`.
